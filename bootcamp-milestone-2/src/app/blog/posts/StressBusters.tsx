        I have been trying to get into new hobbies lately, so I've just been
        doing whatever seems fun at the moment. Here are some of the things I've
        tried:
      </p>

      <h3>
        Tidepooling <span>(10/10)</span>
      </h3>
      <p>
        I am a huge nerd for marine life, so this was right up my alley. I went
        to Half Moon Bay with some friends and we found so many cool things! We
        saw sea stars, anemones, crabs, and even a small octopus! It was so fun
        to explore the tide pools and see all the different creatures. The only
        downside is that it’s cold and you can slip easily.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Birdwatching <span>(6/10)</span>
      </h3>
      <p>
        I downloaded an app called <em>Merlin Bird ID</em> and went to a nearby
        park to see what birds I could find. I saw a bunch of different species,
        and it was fun learning about them through the app and trying to
        identify them. However, it got a bit boring after a while, and most of
        the birds I saw were pretty common.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Feeding Stray Kittens in My Yard <span>(11/10)</span>
      </h3>
      <p>
        This has been the most rewarding hobby by far! I've been putting out
        food for the stray kittens in my neighborhood, and it's been so much fun
        to watch them come and go. I've named a few of them, but my favorite cat
        is definitely the runt that I lovingly named Sunny Side Down Egg. It's a
        great way to relax and de-stress, plus I feel like I'm making a
        difference in their lives. The only bad thing are the amount of
        yellowjackets that are attracted to the food, but it's worth it for the
        cute kittens.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Yoga <span>(4/10)</span>
      </h3>
      <p>
        I grew up doing yoga with my dad, so I thought maybe I would have come
        around to it by now. However, I still find it quite boring, and if I
        listen closely enough, I can still hear my dad's voice telling me to sit
        still and focus. I'll try again soon if I feel really stressed.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Bouldering <span>(3/10)</span>
      </h3>
      <p>
        I have a deadly fear of heights, so I thought this would be a good way
        to face my fears. However, I found that I was too scared to climb very
        high, and I didn't really enjoy it. Also, my friends are way better at
        it than me, so I got a bit butthurt.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Hiking <span>(7/10)</span>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Again, the fear of heights kicked in, but the views make it worth it,
        and I have good stamina, so the hike was still enjoyable overall. I went
        to Mount Tamalpais and the views from the top were absolutely
        breathtaking!
      </p>

      <h3>Overall Thoughts</h3>
